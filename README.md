# ⚔️ PromptHeist — The Ultimate AI Battle Arena

> *“Where creativity meets competition — and every word counts.”*

## 🚀 About the Project

**PromptHeist** is a real-time **AI Battle Arena** where players compete to craft the most powerful prompts.
Two users enter, both receive the same challenge — and their prompts face off. The AI (GPT-4o / Claude / Gemini) judges both responses and crowns a winner based on creativity, clarity, and context relevance.

We built PromptHeist to make **learning prompt engineering fun, social, and competitive** — because why should learning AI feel boring?

## 🧠 Why We Built It

AI tools are everywhere — but few people know how to *talk* to them effectively.
PromptHeist bridges that gap by turning the art of prompting into a **gameified learning experience**.
Instead of reading tutorials, users learn through battles, feedback, and laughter.

It’s not just a game. It’s a **playground for AI literacy** — built for hackers, creators, and learners who want to get better at using AI.
